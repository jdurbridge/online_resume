                <h1>The online shopping centre</h1>
                <h3>May 2020</h3>
                <p>The lockdown and closure of shopping centres during the Coronavirus outbreak, brought to light the importance of bricks and mortar retailers having a digital backup channel for sales.</p>

                <p>Shopping centres by their very nature are physical locations playing host to a carefully curated mix of stores, all offering tangible experiences for customers. This is why people relish the experience of going to a shopping centre. However, there is a place for more commercialised shopping centre websites, that like department store sites and online fashion retailers such as ASOS, can allow its customers the opportunity to browse its store’s inventory’s, and purchase online for delivery or click and collect.</p>
                
                <p>We have begun working with our shopping centre clients to introduce this offering in the form of ‘Affiliate Marketing’ schemes. With this functionality, a shopping centre can set up product pages featuring their tenant’s key collections. Customers can then view, save, inspect and purchase from a retailer, via the shopping centre’s website. An array of additional services such as checking stock levels, increased product information and even chatbot assistance can be wrapped around this experience, so a customer feels like they have ‘virtually’ visited the centre.</p>
                
                <p>An increasingly likely path to purchase is “research online, buy offline”, so this platform won’t detract too much from the physical footfall. It will instead provide opportunities for increased sales, whilst also driving some physical footfall from online services.</p>
                
                <p>Retailers that have adapted to changes in consumer behaviour, have seamlessly surfaced relevant information in the right channels, using the Internet as a powerful tool to enhance their existing brick-and-mortar stores. Those who embrace this customer journey now will surely reap the rewards, ahead of those who fail to innovate and adapt.</p>
                
                <p>Talk to BWP about affiliation marketing now, to make sure you’re ready for the next chapter of retailing.
